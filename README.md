## Getting Started

### 1. Database Setup

1. Install PostgreSQL if not already installed
2. Create the database:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE ambulance_service;
   ```

### 2. Configuration

Update `application.properties` with your database credentials:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/ambulance_service
spring.datasource.username=your_username
spring.datasource.password=your_password
```

### 3. Build and Run the Application

```bash
# Build the application
./mvnw clean package

# Run the application
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8080`

## API Documentation

When the application is running, you can access:
- Swagger UI: `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`
- API Docs (JSON): `http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs`

## Running Tests

To run all tests:

```bash
./mvnw test
```

To run a specific test class:

```bash
./mvnw test -Dtest=ServiceHistoryServiceTest
```

To run a specific test method:

```bash
./mvnw test -Dtest=ServiceHistoryServiceTest#testUpdateServiceStatus_ValidTransition
```

## Frontend

The frontend is a separate React application. You can access the live version at [Ambulance Service Provider UI](https://ambulance-service-provider-ui.vercel.app/).

## API Endpoints

### Public Endpoints
- `GET /api/ambulances` - Get list of all ambulances
- `POST /api/auth/register` - Register a new user
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Authenticate and get JWT token

### Secured Endpoints
(Requires valid JWT token)
- `GET /api/requests` - Get all service requests (ADMIN only)
- `POST /api/requests` - Create a new service request
- `GET /api/requests/{id}` - Get request details

## ðŸš€ Deployment

This application is configured for deployment on [Render](https://render.com/). Follow these steps to deploy:

### Prerequisites
- A Render account
- GitHub/GitLab account with access to this repository
- (Optional) A custom domain (if you want to use your own domain)

### Deploy to Render

1. **Fork this repository** to your GitHub/GitLab account

2. **Sign in to Render**
   - Go to [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com/)
   - Click "New +" and select "Blueprint"
   - Connect your GitHub/GitLab account if you haven't already

3. **Configure your repository**
   - Select the forked repository
   - Give your service a name (e.g., "ambulance-service")
   - Select the branch you want to deploy (usually `main` or `master`)
   - Click "Apply"

4. **Configure environment variables**
   - Go to the "Environment" tab in your Render dashboard
   - Add the following environment variables:
     - `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=production`
     - `JWT_SECRET` (generate a strong secret key)
     - `JWT_EXPIRATION=86400000` (24 hours in milliseconds)
   - The database credentials will be automatically injected by Render

5. **Start the deployment**
   - Click "Save Changes"
   - Go to the "Manual Deploy" tab and click "Deploy latest commit"

6. **Wait for deployment to complete**
   - The build and deployment process will start automatically
   - You can monitor the progress in the logs

In production (on Render), the following configurations are automatically applied:
- Database is provisioned and managed by Render
- HTTPS is automatically configured
- Automatic deployments on push to the main branch
- Health checks and auto-restart on failure

### Custom Domain (Optional)

To use a custom domain:
1. Go to your service in the Render dashboard
